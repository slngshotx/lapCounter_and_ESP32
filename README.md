## Race Coordinator Arduino and ESP32 sketch
This repository contains a modified version of the Race Coordinator Arduino sketch.

This version will work on an ESP32 (dev kit only tested) aswell as an Arduino R3/mega, although not all features have been tested i.e. RGB LED and fuel stutter. The code will detect which board is being used and **should** just work for both Arduino and ESP32 without any further code changes.

## Wireless Bluetooth
If you add *#define ESP32_BT* at the start of the sketch then the board will usea Bluetooth serial connection to communicate with RC. The board will then appear as a bluetooth device called **RC Lap Counter**. Connecting the PC to this device will create 2 new COM ports, one of these (probably lower number) can be used as the Arduino address in RC track management.

### Caveats
- Select the Mega board in Race Coordinator since that allows configuration of all pins.
- Do **not** configure pins 6,7,8,9,10 and 11 in the RC configuration screen, ensure they are set to *RESERVED*. On ESP32 these pins are reserved for flash memory use and will crash the board
- Bluetooth classic is only available on some ESP32 implementation i.e. DevKit and will **not** work on S3 board.
